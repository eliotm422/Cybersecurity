## Linux

As we already know, Linux-based systems handle everything in the form of a file. Accordingly, passwords are also stored encrypted in a file. This file is called the shadow file and is located in /etc/shadow and is part of the Linux user management system. In addition, these passwords are commonly stored in the form of hashes. An example can look like this:

#### Shadow File

Shadow File

root@htb:~# cat /etc/shadow

Minimuss74@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd

  
  

#### Windows Authentication Process Diagram

  

Local interactive logon is performed by the interaction between the logon process ([WinLogon](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2228450&seqNum=8)), the logon user interface process (LogonUI), the credential providers, LSASS, one or more authentication packages, and SAM or Active Directory. Authentication packages, in this case, are the Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) that perform authentication checks. For example, for non-domain joined and interactive logins, the authentication package Msv1_0.dll is used.

Winlogon is a trusted process responsible for managing security-related user interactions. These include:

- Launching LogonUI to enter passwords at login
    
- Changing passwords
    
- Locking and unlocking the workstation
