## Question 1 :

John needs to choose a firewall that can protect against SQL injection attacks. Which of the following types of firewalls is suitable for this task?

Votre réponse est correcte

Web application firewall.
Explication générale

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall)

A web application firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks exploiting a web application's known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.

## Q2

DAI

Explication générale

**_Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI)_** protects switching devices against Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packet spoofing (also known as ARP poisoning or ARP cache poisoning).

## Q3 

Which of the following is a network software suite designed for 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured?

aircrack ng

## q4

Based on the following data, you need to calculate the approximate cost of recovery of the system operation per year:

The cost of a new hard drive is $300;

The chance of a hard drive failure is 1/3;

The recovery specialist earns $10/hour;

Restore the OS and software to the new hard disk - 10 hours;

Restore the database from the last backup to the new hard disk - 4 hours;

Assume the EF = 1 (100%), calculate the SLE, ARO, and ALE.

Explication générale

1. **AV (Asset value)** = $300 + (14 * $10) = $440 - the cost of a hard drive plus the work of a recovery person, i.e.how much would it take to replace 1 asset? 10 hours for resorting the OS and soft + 4 hours for DB restore multiplies by hourly rate of the recovery person.

2. **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** = AV * EF (Exposure Factor) = $440 * 1 = $440

3. **ARO (Annual rate of occurrence)** = 1/3 (every three years, meaning the probability of occurring during 1 years is 1/3)

4. **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)** = SLE * ARO = 0.33 * $440 = $145.2

## Q6

Which of the following wireless standard has bandwidth up to 54 Mbit/s and signals in a regulated frequency spectrum around 5 GHz?

## Q8

Which of the following will allow you to prevent unauthorized network access to local area networks and other information assets by wireless devices?

WIPS Explication générale

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_intrusion_prevention_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_intrusion_prevention_system)

A Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) is a network device that monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized access points (intrusion detection), and can automatically take countermeasures (intrusion prevention).

**_AIDS_**

Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks, in part due to the rapid development of malware.


**_NIDS_** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system#Network_intrusion_detection_systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system#Network_intrusion_detection_systems)

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network

**Incorrect answers:**

**_HIDS_** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host-based_intrusion_detection_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host-based_intrusion_detection_system)

A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an intrusion detection system that is capable of monitoring and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces


## Q9

How works the mechanism of a Boot Sector Virus?

Moves the MBR to another location on the hard disk and copies itself to the original location of the MBR.


# Q10

**_According to the EC-Council's study guides, the Insertion Attack looks like this:_** The attacker can send packets whose time-to-live (TTL) fields are crafted to reach the IDS but not the target computers



Explication générale
